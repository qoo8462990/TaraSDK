###############################

In order to install the Tara SDK package, the steps to be followed are

	i. Extract the tar archive using the command. After running the command, there will be a
		directory named ‘Tara_SDK_LINUX_REL_PACKAGE_xxxx’
			$ tar -xhzvf Tara_SDK_LINUX_REL_package_xxxx.tar.gz

	ii. Change the location to the Prebuilts folder in the extracted package.
			$ cd <Extracted Package Location>/Tara_SDK_LINUX_REL_PACKAGE_xxxx/Prebuilts

	iii. Run the install.sh shell script with superuser privilege. This will install the prebuilt 
		binaries and libraries for the respective LTS version and architecture into the path 
		“/usr/local/tara-sdk” and append the path variables to bashrc and /etc/profile.
			$ sudo ./install.sh
			
	iv. Reload the shell to use the modified environment variables by using the command.
			$ source ~/.bashrc

5. How To Run Binaries in Prebuilts Folder:
###########################################

	To run the binaries, Make sure the the Tara SDK package is installed and dependencies are
	installed. (Refer section-3 and section-4). If those steps are done, then run the applications
	with the following command,
	
		$ sudo -i <BinaryName>
		
		For Example, $ sudo -i TaraCamViewer
					 $ sudo -i FaceDetection
		
		List of Binaries : FaceDetection, HeightCalibration, HeightEstimation, ImuApplication, 
		PointCloud, TaraCamViewer, TaraDepthViewer, TaraDisparityViewer, VolumeEstimation.
	
	i. Once the application is launched, list of enumerated camera devices will be displayed.
	   Select the Device ID with the name See3CAM_Stereo.
	   
	ii. If the stereo Device ID is correctly selected, the resolutions supported by the device will be
		displayed. Select the Resolution ID to start streaming the camera with that resolution.

	iii. The image windows streaming the left and right frames or disparity are shown.
		a) Press ‘q/Q/Esc’ on the image window to quit the application.
		b) Press ‘e/E’ on the image window to change the exposure of the camera. Exposure
			ranges from 10 to 1000000 micro seconds. Initially the exposure is set to 15000 micro
			seconds.
		c) Press ‘b/B’ on the image window to alter the brightness of the camera. Range is from 1
			to 7.
		d) Press ‘r/R’ on the image window to view the right image of the camera in the samples
			where the right frame is not displayed.
		e) Press ‘d/D’ on the image window to view the gray scale disparity map in the Depth
			viewer and Disparity viewer application.

Note : Refer to the Tara_SDK_Linux_User_Manual to know about each of the application included in SDK.
		

6. Uninstalling Tara SDK package:
#################################		

In order to uninstall the Tara SDK package, the steps to be followed are

	i. Change the location to the Prebuilts folder in the extracted package.
			$ cd <Extracted Package Location>/Tara_SDK_LINUX_REL_PACKAGE_xxxx/Prebuilts
		
	ii. Run the uninstall.sh shell script with superuser privilege. This will remove the binaries from
		the installed location and delete the path variables added to bashrc and /etc/profile.
			$ sudo ./uninstall.sh
