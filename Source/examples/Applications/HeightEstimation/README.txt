    CONSOLE APPLICATION : HeightEstimation Project Overview
========================================================================
The order of execution:
	1) Height Calibration
	2) Height Estimation

Height Calibration:
-------------------

	This is used for calibrating the height of the base from the camera. 
	The base is determined by averaging(minimum of 10 frames) the depth of a point selected by a user on the disparity map.
	The depth calculated is written to the file named "BaseHeight" and placed in the folder named "Height".
	The file is used by the height estimation to determine the height.

Note: 
	Make sure the folder "Height" is created in prior to launching the application.
	
Height Estimation:
------------------

	The Height of the person standing under the camera is estimated with the reference to the "BaseHeight" file generated by the HeightCalibration project.
	The Height of the person is actually selected by scanning the depth in the 1/3 of the diaparity map. the lowest depth is selected as the depth of the head.
	The Head depth is subtracted from the base depth and the height of the person is displayed.

Note: 
	Make the sure the person head is in 1/3 of the frame and Height calibration is executed first.
	Perform HeightCalibration before running HeightEstimation.
